# Overview

This work was done as part of a coding test for a job that I applied for.  The exact requirements were:

## Requirements

Program a model of a vending machine. It should at least satisfy the following requirements:

* Contains various products, each of which can be retrieved by entering in the correct amount of money, and then punching in the code for that item
* Dispenses change after making a purchase
* Has a cancel button that returns the user's change
* Ability to stock/restock items in the machine
* Any other functionality that you think a vending machine should have!

It is not required that you build any sort of user interface, but there should be some demonstration of the modelâ€™s functionality.  Write this code as if it were going into production.

## My Approach

I wrote this as a command line driven Ruby project that you communicate with along the lines of an old school text adventure.  There are a series of verbs like "buy", "pay" and others.

## Directions

Here is how to run the code:

1.  Clone this project down to your local machine.
2.  There should be no gems or dependencies; if you have a Ruby development environment, it should just work.
3.  If you don't have a Ruby development environment then there is an accompanying screencast which illustrates the functionality as a .mp4 file.
4.  If you are running it then cd into your cloned repo and then run **ruby vending_machine.rb**
5.  Tests can be run with
